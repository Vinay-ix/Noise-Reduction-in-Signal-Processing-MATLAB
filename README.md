# Noise Reduction in Signal Processing 🎧

This project explores various techniques for reducing noise in real-world signals using MATLAB, focusing on the **Least Mean Square (LMS) algorithm**. It's part of our coursework for the *BECE301L - Digital Signal Processing* lab at VIT Chennai.

## 📌 Project Overview

Noise is an unavoidable component in real-world signals that often degrades system performance. This project uses MATLAB to implement and evaluate techniques like:
- Filtering
- Fourier Transform
- Least Mean Square (LMS) Adaptive Filter
- Gaussian Filter

We demonstrate how LMS can be used to significantly improve signal quality.
